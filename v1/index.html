          <p>Simultaneously, a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending on occasion. You can also position elements in spatial juxtaposition, or create entrances to adjacent rooms through links.</p>
          <p>In the early days of The Creative Independent, we sometimes thought of TCI’s website like a house next to a river. We considered the interviews the flowing water, as they were our house’s nutrients and source of life.</p>
          <p>We would collect and drink from the water every day. But sometimes, depending on its nutrient makeup, the water would change our house. We’d wake up to see a new door where a picture frame once was. Knowledge became the architect.</p>
          <p>Like any metaphor, it’s not perfect. For better or worse, it’s much more difficult to delete a building than a website.</p>

          <p>A few small things will do, knowledge-containing or not. Plus, lighter things are easy to change out. Is a book or trinket “so last year?” Move it off the shelf! Consider what surprising juxtapositions you can make on your little shelf.</p>

            <p>Fred Rogers said you can grow ideas in the garden of your mind. Sometimes, once they’re little seedlings and can stand on their own, it helps to plant them outside, in a garden, next to the others.</p>
            <p>Gardens have their own ways each season. In the winter, not much might happen, and that’s perfectly fine. You might spend the less active months journaling in your notebook: less output, more stirring around on input. You need both. Plants remind us that life is about balance.</p>
            <p>It’s nice to be outside working on your garden, just like it’s nice to quietly sit with your ideas and place them onto separate pages.</p>

            <p>A website could also be a puddle. A puddle is a temporary collection of rainwater. They usually appear after rainstorms. Like a storm, creating a website can happen in a burst. Sometimes it’s nice to have a few bursts/storms of creating a website, since the zone can be so elusive. Some people even call rain “computer weather.”</p>
            <p>There is also no state of “completeness” to a website, like a puddle, since they’re ephemeral by nature. Sometimes they can be very big and reflective. Despite their temporal nature, I’ve even seen some creatures thrive in puddles. Meanwhile, some smaller puddles may only last a day.</p>
            <p> Not everything, even the most beautiful puddle with its incredible reflective surface, needs to last long. If the world doesn’t end tomorrow, there will be another storm. And where there’s a hole, a puddle will appear again.</p>
            <p>Puddles evaporate slowly over time. It might be difficult, but I would love to see a website evaporate slowly, too.</p>

            <p>Sometimes you don’t want a website that you’ll have to maintain. You have other things to do. Why not consider your website a beautiful rock with a unique shape which you spent hours finding, only to throw it into the water until it hits the ocean floor? You will never know when it hits the floor, and you won’t care.</p>
            <p>Thankfully, rocks are plentiful and you can do this over and over again, if you like. You can throw as many websites as you want into the ocean. When an idea comes, find a rock and throw it.</p>

    <h4>
      <p>While an individual website could be any of those metaphors I mentioned above,</p>
      <p>I believe the common prevailing metaphor—the internet as cloud—is problematic.</p>
      <p>The internet is not one all-encompassing, mysterious, and untouchable thing.</p>
      <p>(In early patent drawings depicting the internet, it appears as related shapes: a blob, brain, or explosion.)</p>
      <p>These metaphors obfuscate the reality that the internet is made up of individual nodes:</p>
      <p>individual computers talking to other individual computers.</p>
    <p><img src="cloud.jpg" alt="Cloud" width="600" height="550"></p>
      <p>The World Wide Web recently turned 29.</p>
      <p>On the web’s birthday, Tim Berners Lee, its creator, published a letter stating the web’s current state of threat.</p>
      <p>He says that while it’s called the “World Wide Web,”</p>
      <p>only about half the world is connected, so we should close this digital divide.</p>
      <p>But at the same time, Berners Lee wants to make sure this thing we’re all connecting to is truly working for us,</p>
      <p>as individuals: “I want to challenge us all to have greater ambitions for the web.</p>
      <p>I want the web to reflect our hopes and fulfill our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions.”</p>
    </h4>
    <p><img src="Sky.jpg" alt="Sky" width="600" height="550"></p>
      <p><h3>“Metaphor unites reason and imagination,”</h3></p>
    <h4>
      <p>says George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their book, Metaphors We Live By (1980).</p> 
      <p>“Metaphors are not merely things to be seen beyond. In fact, one can see beyond them only by using other metaphors.</p>
      <p>It is as though the ability to comprehend experience through metaphor were a sense,</p>
      <p>like seeing or touching or hearing, with metaphors providing the only ways to perceive and experience much of the world.</p>
      <p>Metaphor is as much a part of our functioning as our sense of touch, and as precious.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Instead of a cloud, let’s use a metaphor that makes the web’s individual, cooperative nodes more visible.</p>
      <p> This way, we can remember the responsibility we each have in building a better web.</p>
      <p>The web is a flock of birds or a sea of punctuation marks,</p>
      <p>each tending or forgetting about their web garden or puddle home with a river of knowledge nearby.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and expanded by them,</p>
      <p>then it’s instrumental that websites progress along with us.</p>
      <p>It’s especially pressing when forces continue to threaten the web and the internet at large.</p>
      <p>In an age of information overload and an increasingly commercialized web, artists of all types are the people to help.</p>
      <p>Artists can think expansively about what a website can be. Each artist should create their own space on the web,</p>
      <p>for a website is an individual act of collective ambition.</p>
